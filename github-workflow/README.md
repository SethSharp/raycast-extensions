# Check Conflicting PRs

A Raycast Extension built to show the status of your open PRs.

Features planned:
- List which shows the number, title and url
- Form to enter information (Not just current default in another repo)

POC:
- Show the files/amount of files needed to fic the conflict
- Store form data (Author, org and NPM token) in local storage to avoid entering multiple times
- Is it safe to store NPM token in local storage
